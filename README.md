# HTN-2025-Portfolio

3 cool things I've built:

- [Superimpose](https://github.com/zs-5/Superimpose): A full body game, where you have to match the poses to fit through the cutouts!

- [HandiSynth](https://github.com/zs-5/HandiSynth): A pretty cool hand controlled synthesiser, that I built with Xiaotian.

- [Missile Mayhem](https://github.com/zs-5/Missile_Mayhem): A fast paced, city defense game, with Fruit Ninja style mechanics, that I built with Umair.
